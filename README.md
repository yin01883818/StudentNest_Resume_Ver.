App that allows college students to keep track of their loans through this app and receive local notifications.
Created with three other college students.
Users would create an account through Google, and users would input each of their loan info to be
tracked through a viewmodel. All loans would be shown on a graph and show when each loan is due.
Users have the option to turn on push notifications as well.
Private user information such as their password is salted and hashed to ensure security.
I was responsible with implementing push notifications to notify users of deadlines for their loans and a
database to keep track of user information.
